It was a significant spice trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.It is the nineteenth largest urban agglomeration in the country and the second largest one in Kerala.[8] Calicut city is the second largest city proper in the state with a corporation limit population of 609,224 [12][13] Calicut is classified as a Tier-2 city by the Government of India.[14]

It is the largest city on the Malabar Coast and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district. It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins).[1] The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to the medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, the Persians, the Arabs, and finally the Europeans.[15] According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode was ranked the second-best city in India to live in.[16] In 2023, Kozhikode was recognised by UNESCO as India's first City of Literature</p>
